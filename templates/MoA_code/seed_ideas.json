EXPERIMENT 1. Augment the user_prompt with instruction to make sure each LLM generates a final submission code only in string. DO NOT include any text explanation and a code block with three backticks (```). After you complete this change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1'. Compare the execution speed and final performance with the baseline model.",
