        "Experiment": "Extend the GPT agent model for instruction-following tasks to code generation tasks, where the LLM API is called to generate Python code given a problem of programming competition. Augment the user_prompt with instruction to make sure each LLM generates a final submission code only in string, without any text explanation and a code block. Remove a code block if the output code is wrapped with three backticks (```), check the correct indentation to make sure the output can be tested with unit tests. After you complete this change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1'. Compare the execution speed and final performance with the baseline model.",
