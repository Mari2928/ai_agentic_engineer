Experiment 2. Augment the user_prompt using Chain-of-thought approach so that the MoA can better analyze the user's purchase history for the improved next-item prediction. Run Experiment 2 using that prompt. DO NOT attempt more than those two experiments to improve performance. Performance decline is fine, just report so. Please write a report after Experiment 1 and 2, comparing recommendation performance (NDCG@10 scores across 100 users) to baseline of GPT4o. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLOT ANYTHING, BUT MAKE SURE TO PRESENT NUMERICAL RESULTS IN A TABLE.",
